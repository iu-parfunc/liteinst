DESCRIPTION

libzca is an interface to Pin for easy access to the zero-cost annotations
(ZCA) inserted by compilers for certain language features (e.g., Intel(R)
Cilk Plus).

BUILDING

You will need to download a Pin package (http://www.pintool.org/) and
unpack it in a directory called "3rdparty", sibling of cilkutil.  If the
directory that gets unpacked is not called pintool, rename it to pintool.

After that, you can build the libzca archive using the following steps:

% cd /path/to/cilkutil/zca/src
% make OUT=<platform>

... where valid <platform> values are "linux32" and "linux64", depending
upon your OS.  After the build is complete, you will have a directory of
the same name as your <platform> containing libzca.a, as well as an
example pintool shared object.
