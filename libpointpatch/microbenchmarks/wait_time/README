* wait_time.sh 
  Script runs test_patch_parallel5.exe with different wait trip counts
  to find the passing setting. 
  TODO: Tweak ranges of trip counts and run on more machines. 

* time_wait.c 
  Tries to estimate the time a wait loop takes at different trip counts. 
  This is an artificial "benchmark"
