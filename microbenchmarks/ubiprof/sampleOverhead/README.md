Dynaprof Sampling Overhead
==============================

This benchmark measures the cost of dynaprof samples themselves, as a
function of three parameters:

 * NUMFUNS,    F - number of distinct functions
 * NUMCALLS,   N - number of calls to each function (averaging)
 * MEMTRAFFIC, M - amount of memory traffic between calls to a function
